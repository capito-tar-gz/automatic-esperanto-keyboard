# automatic-esperanto-keyboard
A keyboard layout for Mac OS X that converts x-system to Esperanto's capped letters. 

In beta testing.

## Installation

* In the dist folder, you'll find a dmg file. Click on that, and drag the keyboard bundle into the keyboard library folder.
* Restart, or logout/login
* Select QWERTY or Dvorak versions of this keyboard under the "Esperanto" language section in your keyboard settings.

## Usage

For typing circumflex and breve Esperanto characters:

Type using the x-system convention. When you type a lower case x after c, g, h, j, and s, your keyboard will convert those characters to their Esperanto equivalent.

Example: "Cx" would produce "Ĉ". "sx" would produce "ŝ". "CX" would produce "CX" since people generally don't capitalize the x when writing in that system.

NOTE: If you need to type x after a letter without conversion, note that you can use the backtick character (`), usually found above the tab key, to produce x in these circumstances.

Example: "c`" becomes "cx". 

This is done for special cases, such as words like "faux pas" or "auxiliary."
